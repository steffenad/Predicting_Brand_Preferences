Classification in R - Brand Preferences

Based on a customers survey conducted by an external market research firm, the task is to find out which of the brands “Sony” and “Acer” is preferred by the customers.

There are 10.000 complete answered interviews of the customers and 5.000 incomplete interviews. In the interviews the customers reveal their "salary", "age", "elevel"(educational level), "zipcode"(region), "credit"(loan amounting), and their "brand" preference. In the incomplete interviews the "brand" preference is missing.

Therefore, with the help of the complete observations, predictions about the missing responses can be made.
Then the full survey of 15.000 interviews can give a clear picture of customers brand preferences.
